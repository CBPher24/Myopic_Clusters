# Myopic_Clusters
Investigating Myopia data using unsupervised learning to fit it to a model and using clustering algorithms

Recommendation

While the tSNE data plot showed little results, we were definitely able to to create some clusters using K-Means. It 
will be a judgement call on whether to use 2 or 3 clusters. The elbow curve was still at a descent decline before 3, 
but it was a really steep decline getting to 2. I decided to go ahead and plot both and they both showed clustering.
Using 3 clusters feel you might get smaller groups to analyze, but going with 2 clusters and the fact a patient is
either myopic or not would give you more definitive data.
